# Social Media Backend API | Node.js Express REST API

A production-ready RESTful API for social media applications built with Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, and Prisma. This capstone project demonstrates full-stack development capabilities with secure authentication, social features, and scalable architecture.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

Built as the final capstone project for The Odin Project's full-stack curriculum, this social media backend showcases the ability to design and implement complex, production-grade APIs that handle authentication, data relationships, file uploads, and performance optimization.

## 💡 Key Learning Outcomes

- **RESTful API Design**: Implemented proper HTTP methods, status codes, and error handling following industry best practices
- **Authentication & Security**: JWT token-based authentication with bcrypt password hashing and rate limiting for security
- **Database Architecture**: Designed PostgreSQL schema with proper indexing, relationships, and cascading deletes using Prisma ORM
- **Test-Driven Development**: Comprehensive testing suite with Jest and Supertest, demonstrating TDD methodology
- **Performance Optimization**: Implemented cursor-based pagination and database indexing for scalable data retrieval
- **File Management**: Integrated Cloudinary for cloud-based file storage with Multer for upload handling
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error response format with proper HTTP status codes and validation

## 🚀 Core Features

- **Secure Authentication** with JWT tokens and bcrypt password hashing
- **User Profiles** with customizable details and profile photos
- **User Search** with partial, case-insensitive username matching
- **Social Networking** with follow/unfollow system
- **Posts System** with create, read, update, delete functionality and pagination
- **Comments System** with create, read, delete functionality and rate limiting
- **Like System** for posts with user-specific like status tracking
- **Feed System** with home feed (followed users) and explore feed (all posts)
- **File Uploads** via Cloudinary integration for profile photos
- **Rate Limiting** for API abuse prevention
- **RESTful Design** following industry best practices

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: JWT + Passport.js
- **File Storage**: Cloudinary + Multer
- **Security**: bcrypt, CORS, input validation, rate limiting
- **Testing**: Jest, Supertest (TDD approach)
- **Development**: Prisma Studio, hot reload

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Clone and install**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd social-media-backend
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your database and Cloudinary credentials
   ```

3. **Database setup**
   ```bash
   npm run db:generate
   npm run db:migrate
   ```

4. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## 📊 Project Highlights

### Technical Challenges Overcome
- **Authentication Flow**: Designed secure JWT-based authentication with 10-minute token expiration
- **Database Relationships**: Implemented complex many-to-many relationships for follow system with proper cascading deletes
- **Performance**: Optimized database queries with indexing and cursor-based pagination for large datasets
- **File Upload Security**: Integrated Cloudinary with validation and error handling for profile photo uploads
- **Rate Limiting**: Implemented custom rate limiting middleware to prevent API abuse

### Testing Strategy
- **Test-Driven Development**: Comprehensive testing approach with Jest and Supertest
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Integration tests for API endpoints, authentication, and error handling
- **Test Utilities**: Created reusable helpers for authentication and database operations
- **Continuous Testing**: Jest watch mode for development efficiency
